The Interagency ADR Working Group was established by Presidential Memorandum dated May 1, 1998, to assist federal agencies in developing and implementing ADR programs. The Working Group's members are ADR professionals in agencies across the Federal Government.  The President appointed the Attorney General as the leader of the Interagency Working Group.

## The Sections of the Working Group

To accomplish the tasks of the Working Group, discrete Sections were created within the Working Group to assist federal agencies in creating ADR programs in specific subject matter areas. Those Sections are:

* Workplace Conflict Management
* Contracts and Procurement
* Administrative Enforcement and Regulatory Process
* Litigation

The Working Group has operated primarily through these Sections to provide technical assistance and guidance on best practices in ADR program development. These Sections regularly conduct training sessions, meetings, and colloquia on all aspects of ADR.

## The Working Group's Steering Committee

The Steering Committee is the staff-level committee that supports the work of the Sections and the Working Group. Many members of the Steering Committee serve as their agency's designated Dispute Resolution Specialist and are also responsible for the operation of ADR programs within their own organizations.

Since its inception, the Interagency ADR Working Group has broadened its scope to include subcommittees for Arbitration, Ethics, Collaborative Governance, Environmental ADR and other areas.

* Environmental Conflict Resolution

## Reports on Federal ADR Programs

The Interagency ADR Working Group has submitted two Reports to the President regarding ADR programs through the federal government.  These reports are detailed accounts of the current ADR programs in every federal agency.

* Report for the President on Significant Developments in Federal Alternative Dispute Resolution, January 2017 (PDF)
    * Appendix with reports from individual agency ADR programs (PDF)
* Report for the President on the Use and Results of Alternative Dispute Resolution in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, April 2007 (PDF)

* Congress made the ADRA permanent by reauthorizing key provisions and deleting the sunset provision with the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-320 (amending Pub. L. No. 101-552 and Pub. L. No. 102-354), 5 U.S.C.§§ 571-581 (2011); see also clean version with all codified provisions.

* Congress enacted the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 (Reg Neg Act), Pub. L. No, 101-648, "to encourage agencies to use negotiated rulemaking when it enhances the informal rulemaking process."
