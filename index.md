## Federal ADR Programs and Contacts

President Clinton issued a 1998 order requiring that each federal agency develop a policy to promote greater use of ADR in administrative disputes. The Interagency Working Group was established as a resource for developing ADR programs and sharing information to support the use of ADR.

The ADR policies and programs of many of the federal agencies are listed [here](/fai). We provide an index of federal agencies with links to learn more about each agency's ADR programs and policies.
